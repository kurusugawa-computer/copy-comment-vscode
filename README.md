# Copy comment without comment symbols for Visual Studio Code

## üåü feature

**copy-comment-vscode** makes it possible to copy text in code without comment symbols (e.g. `//`, `/*`, `#`).

When working with vscode, you may come across long comments written in a certain language. In order to translate this using Google Translate etc., you will copy the comment and paste it to translation services, but the copied content contains comment symbols such as `/*`, `//` and `#`, so the translation doesn't work. This extention solve this problem.

There is already comment translation extensions but it has the risk of leaking code that should not be leaked to the outside.

## üìù Usage
1. Select text you want to translate.
2. Click the right mouse button and select `Copy without comment symbols`.
3. Copied to clipboard without comment symbols!
