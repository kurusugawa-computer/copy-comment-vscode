# Copy comment without comment symbols for Visual Studio Code

## üåü Feature

The `copy-comment-vscode` extension enables you to copy text from code comments without including comment symbols (e.g., //, /\*, #).

When working with vscode, you might encounter long comments written in a certain language. Often, to translate these comments using services like Google Translate, you need to copy and paste the text. However, the copied content contains comment symbols like `/*`, `//` and `#`. They can interfere with the translation process. This extension addresses this issue by allowing you to copy comments free of any comment symbols.

While there are other comment translation extensions available, they risk exposing sensitive code to external services. `copy-comment-vscode` provides a safer alternative by only copying the comment text.

## üìù Usage

1. Select the text in your code that you want to translate.
2. Right-click and choose "Copy without comment symbols" from the context menu.
3. The text will be copied to your clipboard without any comment symbols, ready for use.
